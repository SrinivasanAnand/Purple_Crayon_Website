            <h1 class="header">Who are we?</h1>
            <p class="aboutText" id="firstText">The Purple Crayon is America’s oldest collegiate longform improv group.
                We specialize in the Harold, a longform improvisation format that spins
                three separate storylines into one intricately-woven narrative.
                Most of all, we’re a group of people who love to perform, hang out,
                and laugh together.</p>

            <h1 class="header">Performances & Tour</h1>
            <p class="aboutText">We perform regularly on campus and we tour the country twice a year! 
                Although we specialize in the Harold, we love to experiment with a 
                variety of improvisational formats. In this past year, we have performed 
                La Rondes, musical shows, murder mysteries, and more.Recent tour destinations 
                include Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, New York, Washington DC, and Philadelphia. 
                On tour, we perform at local comedy clubs and venues and host workshops at 
                local schools and organizations.</p>

            <h1 class="header">Wait, what exactly is Improv?</h1>
            <p class="aboutText">Improv is a performance without a script. It’s the UFC 
                in a world of WWE. We make up scenes completely on the spot based on a 
                single suggestion from the audience. It’ll leave you saying, “Wow, they 
                really came up with that just now?” To which, we’ll respond, “yes.”</p>
